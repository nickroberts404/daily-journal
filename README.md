## Daily Journal
Daily Journal was built to help me keep small summaries of my day's activities to look back and reflect on, with a Github inspired contribution calendar for motivation/navigation. It implements react-beautiful-dnd so the items can be quickly reorganized, and LocalStorage to persist data.
